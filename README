CSPM-AWS-AutoRemediation – CSPM findings Auto-Remediation framework for AWS

The solution is auto-remediation framework for the security standards violation findings discovered by Netskope Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM).
Netskope CSPM continuously assess public cloud deployments to mitigate risk, detect threats, scans and protect sensitive data and monitor for regulatory compliance. Netskope simplifies the discovery of security misconfigurations across your clouds and this framework enables you to automatically mitigate the risk associated with these misconfigurations. 

Netskope CSPM security assessment results for such security benchmark standards as NIST, CIS, PCI DSS and more, as well as your custom rules evaluation results are available via the View Security Assessment Violations Netskope API. 
The solution deploys the set of AWS Lambada functions that queries this API on the scheduled intervals and mitigates supported violations automatically. You can deploy the solution as is, or to customize and expand it to meet your specific organization’s security requirements. 
The solution is regional and works across your organization’s accounts. It’s recommended to deploy the solution on the delegated security management account. It can be the same account that’s been used as delegated administrator for Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub, or another delegated account. It’s not recommended to deploy the solution on the AWS Organization Management account. The solution shall be deployed in each AWS region.
